## Quantum Neural Network Architecture

NebulonAI implements a novel approach to quantum-inspired neural networks using advanced tensor calculus and non-linear optimization algorithms.

### Mathematical Foundation

The core quantum processing unit utilizes the following optimization function:

```math
‚Ñí(Œ∏) = ‚àë_{i=1}^n w_i |œà_i‚ü©‚ü®œà_i| + Œª‚àá¬≤H(œÅ)
```

where:
- `|œà_i‚ü©` represents the quantum state vector
- `w_i` are the synaptic weights
- `Œª` is the regularization parameter
- `H(œÅ)` is the von Neumann entropy

## System Requirements

- Node.js ‚â• 18.0.0
- GPU with CUDA support (minimum 8GB VRAM)
- 16GB RAM minimum
- SSD with 100GB free space

## Performance Metrics

| Module | Latency (ms) | Throughput (ops/s) | Memory (MB) |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Neural | 0.42        | 2,380             | 842         |
| Quantum | 0.67       | 1,490             | 1,248       |
| Core    | 0.31       | 3,220             | 512         |

### Quantum Processing Terms

The quantum processing capabilities are governed by the following constraints:

```math
‚àÄx ‚àà X: P(x) ‚â§ max{Œª‚ÇÅQ(x), Œª‚ÇÇR(x)}
```

where:
- X is the set of all possible quantum states
- P(x) is the processing power allocated
- Q(x) is the quantum efficiency factor
- R(x) is the resource utilization metric
- Œª‚ÇÅ, Œª‚ÇÇ are optimization parameters

## Security Considerations

### Encryption Protocol

All neural network communications are encrypted using:

```math
E(m) = g^k mod p
```

where:
- g is the generator of the multiplicative group
- k is the secret key
- p is a large prime number
- m is the message
