  *Advanced AI-powered trading system for BeraChain utilizing deep learning and quantitative analysis*
</div>

## Technical Overview

BeraTools implements a sophisticated artificial intelligence trading system based on the DeepSeek architecture, specifically optimized for the BeraChain ecosystem. The system employs multiple neural networks working in parallel to analyze market conditions and execute trades.

### Core Components

1. **Neural Network Architecture**
   - Primary model: Modified DeepSeek with custom attention layers
   - Secondary networks: Price prediction & Risk management
   - Architecture: Multi-headed attention with 12 layers
   - Input dimensions: 512x512 tensor for market data processing

```python
def attention_mechanism(Q, K, V, mask=None):
    d_k = Q.size(-1)
    scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d_k)
    
    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
    
    attention = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    return torch.matmul(attention, V)
```

2. **Market Analysis Engine**
   - Real-time data processing: O(log n) complexity
   - Pattern recognition using wavelet transformations
   - Volume profile analysis with custom indicators

### Mathematical Framework

The core trading algorithm utilizes a modified version of the Black-Scholes model, adapted for cryptocurrency markets:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C%28S%2Ct%29%20%3D%20N%28d_1%29S%20-%20N%28d_2%29Ke%5E%7B-rt%7D)

Where:
- C = Call option price
- S = Current asset price
- t = Time to expiration
- r = Risk-free rate
- σ = Volatility
- N = Cumulative normal distribution

## Token Economics

The $TOOLS token implements a sophisticated profit-sharing mechanism:

```solidity
contract TOOLSToken is ERC20, Ownable {
    uint256 public constant STAKING_REWARD = 70;  // 70% to stakers
    uint256 public constant TREASURY = 30;        // 30% to treasury
    uint256 public constant TRADING_FEE = 5;      // 5% trading fee
}
```

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beratools.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
```

## Security

## Mathematical Appendix

### Trading Algorithm

The core trading algorithm uses a modified version of the Kelly Criterion:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f%5E*%20%3D%20p%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1-p%7D%7B%5Cfrac%7Bb%7D%7Ba%7D%7D)

Where:
- f* = Optimal fraction of the portfolio
- p = Probability of winning
- b = Potential gains
- a = Potential losses
