  <strong>Where Nostalgic Gaming Meets Advanced Crypto Analytics</strong>
</div>

## 📊 Overview

MiiAgent revolutionizes crypto analysis by combining the nostalgic charm of Nintendo's Mii characters with cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Our platform employs sophisticated neural networks and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time crypto market insights through an intuitive, retro-gaming inspired interface.

## 🧠 AI Architecture

Our AI system utilizes a multi-layered approach to token analysis:

### Token Valuation Model

The core valuation mechanism employs a modified Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) with custom parameters:

```math
dS(t) = μS(t)dt + σS(t)dW(t)
```

Where:
- S(t) represents the token price at time t
- μ is the drift coefficient (trend)
- σ represents volatility
- W(t) is a Wiener process

### Sentiment Analysis

We implement a hybrid BERT-based model for social sentiment analysis:

```python
sentiment_score = Σ(wi * si) / Σ(wi)
```
- wi: weight of information source i
- si: sentiment score from source i

```

## 🔬 AI Model Architecture

Our neural network implements a custom attention mechanism:

```math
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V
```

Where:
- Q: Query matrix
- K: Key matrix
- V: Value matrix
- dk: Dimension of keys
